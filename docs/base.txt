[1] WHAT THIS PROJECT IS
Hello. This is Open Source C++ lib. for linux sys-admin|devops development.
As well, now (C)Smoky exists only on linux, but as soon, as developer can,
(C)Smoky will be available on other Operating Systems. To use (C)Smoky, 
you need only linux and g++ compiler. You can download source code and 
build it by few commands or use builded bins in a bin directory

[2] HOW TO BUILD
You can use already prepared script: 'build' which could be run with next 
command: 'sh ./build'. Or you would be fine with customizing your build.
I create each module in each pair: cpp:h files, so You may choose -
what you need in your build
